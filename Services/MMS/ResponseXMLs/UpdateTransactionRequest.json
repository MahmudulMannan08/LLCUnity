Encumbrances are things that can be registered against your home and are not always debts- come in all forms of things from mortgages to judgements for unpaid debts like child support or alimony.  Other examples are easements which is basically a right of way across your property.  All utilities (Bell, Rogers, Hydro) have easements on residential properties because their lines are buried there.  An easement would always go with the property no matter who ownes it or if it has a mortgage on it or not.","mortgagors":[{"id":2238,"mortgagorType":"Person","companyName":null,"firstName":"Marilyn","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Monroe","phone":"9052871000","businessPhone":"9052871000","language":"ENGLISH","priorityIndicator":2,"ilaRequired":null,"birthDate":null,"occupation":null,"spouseFirstName":null,"spouseMiddleName":null,"spouseLastName":null,"spouseIlaRequired":null,"spouseoccupation":null,"provinceOfIncorporation":null,"address":{"unitNumber":"1875","streetNumber":"17","streetAddress1":"Lakeshore Blvd. West","streetAddress2":"10th Floor","city":"Toronto","province":"ON","postalCode":"L4Z 6C9","country":"Canada"},"unsecuredDebts":[{"creditor":"BOC","action":"CLSACCNT","amount":3388}],"incorporation":null,"identifications":[{"identificationType":"Foreign Passport","identificationNumber":"0888811398568","expiryDate":"2022-08-03","issuingJurisdiction":"Oakville","issuingCountry":"Canada","verificationDate":null,"fullName":"Marilyn J.
